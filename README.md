# hello-world

I'm a 70 year old, retired and getting back into the programming activity to try to keep my brain ticking. How things have changed over the last 40 years!

My introduction to github has been cloaked in a large degree of bafflement. What are all these things? pushes and pulls and commits and adds and HEADS and what all? I get the general idea but I am still finding the terminology and the actions quite obscure at present.

So these are the steps I took:

git commit -m "README additions step 1"

Quite what that has done I don't know yet. I didn't see anything significant happening so perhaps some background prep has occurred.

It seems that the steps are:

1. Make the changes to a file duh edit a file
2. do the  git commit -m "These a my remarkable changes" -a
3. git push

then put your user name and password in.

Must get markdown magic symbols sorted.

So what's the best way (so far) to use github with your software projects?

1. Make a directory/folder which contains your source code.
2. Create a .gitignore file. This will contain a list of all the file patterns and names that you don't want on github.
3. BTW: Learn how to us MarkDowm (md files)
