# hello-world

I'm a 70 year old, retired and getting back into the programming activity to try to keep my brain ticking. How things have changed over the last 40 years!

My introduction to github has been cloaked in a large degree of bafflement. What are all these things? pushes and pulls and commits and adds and HEADS and what all? I get the general idea but I am still finding the terminology and the actions quite obscure at present.
